# Contributing to cogwatch

I'm open to all input and help! Please open an issue to discuss any changes to the codebase beforehand. This includes
bugs, general refactoring, performance changes, documentation updates, new examples, etc.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If any API's have been modified, update the README section appropriately.
3. Code should respect PEP8.
4. Open your PR!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/robertwayne/cogwatch/issues)

Please include, when you can:

- A quick summary
- Specific steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- Single quotes over double-quotes for strings, except if it would require escaping.
- Use whitespace to break up dense code (if/else, try/catch).
- All library code should be type annotated. Examples should not.

## Check Your Work

- Run the unit & integration tests against each supported library to ensure your
  changes don't break anything.

For integration testing, the available scripts are:

- `poetry run discord4py`
- `poetry run discordpy`
- `poetry run disnake`
- `poetry run nextcord`
- `poetry run pycord`
